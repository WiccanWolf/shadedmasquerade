# The Shaded Masquerade

## Purpose

I have created this website to host an online Alternate Reality Game (ARG) for my players in a Tabletop Dungeons & Dragons 5E game. Whilst being created for the aforementioned purpose, it is a good display of my skills in Frontend design and backend Web Development also.

## Playability

The website can be found at https://wiccanwolf.github.io/shadedmasquerade/. For ease of navigation, the answers to the questions are listed below (the answers are case insensitive, and spaces are removed at runtime);
